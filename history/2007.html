        History From 2007
    </div>
    <div class="textBodyMedium">
        <p>
            In 2007 BRO performed the Beethoven Triple Concerto with visiting Seraphim Trio from Melbourne. The
            orchestra repeated the concert in Cairns with no Cyclone Larry this time!
        </p>
        <p>
            A string ensemble drawn from the larger orchestra was invited by Piers Lane the new Director of the AFCM, to
            perform for the first time in the Australian Festival of Chamber Music, accompanying Australian Opera
            Baritone Peter Coleman-Wright, a very successful concert.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Governor of Queensland became the patron of the Orchestra joining the founding patron Professor John
            Hopkins to inspire the further development of the orchestra and the year culminated in a sell out concert
            featuring James Morrison, conductor Sean O"Boyle, jazz vocalist Emma Pask and a collaboration with
            Townsville Brass and the rythym section from the amazing 1 RAR Band. The event of the year!
