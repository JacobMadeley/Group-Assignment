        History From 2008
    </div>
    <div class="textBodyMedium">
        <p>
            In 2008 this last concert generated an award from the Townsville City Council as "Best Musical Event 2007"
            and after a mammoth launch at the Townsville City CouncilChambers the year began with a concert under the
            baton of visiting UK conductor Mark Eager. This was a collaboration with a combined High Schools orchestra
            and demonstrated the depth of musical talent flowing up from the district's excellent Instrumental Music
            programs. The concert culminated in BRO combining with the high school orchestra for a stirring 1812
            Overture!

            Then followed a terrific concert featuring Matthew Rigby, the 2007 winner of the North Queensland Concerto
            and Vocal Competition, conducted by John Hopkins OBE, continuing a fruitful collboration promoting young
            rising musicians.

            This was closely followed by a 2008 performance at the AFCM with the orchestra ensemble playing a Carl Vine
            composition "The Battlers" which was conducted by the composer. Also at this occasion the orchestra
            accompanied Innisfail-born, London-based concert pianist Piers Lane. The orchestra greatly appreciates such
            opportunities to perform alongside such inspiring artists.
        </p>

            Conductor Richard McIntyre returned with rising Oboist Megan Billing and BRO to perform in Slavonic Swoon,
            featuring works by Dvorak, Smetana and Martinu. 2008 culminated in the return of Sean O'Boyle who brought
            with him James Morrison, Emma Pask and Catherine Lynagh (Qld Piano Competition winner) and another
            collaboration with 1RAR musicians.
