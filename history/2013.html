        History From 2013
    </div>
    <div class="textBodyMedium">
        <p>
            In 2013 we staged three successful concerts with a total audience of 1200 patrons. In March the “Works of
            Art” concert was a sellout at Riverway. Mussorgsky, Strauss and Haydn with conductor Mario Dobernig was well
            received by an appreciative audience. In August we had the well named “Contrasts” concert with conductor
            Raymond Yong and a program varying from Beethoven to Sculthorpe and featuring Elgar’s Cello Concerto with
            Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Yoshika Masuda. This concert was also presented at the
            Burdekin Theatre, our first performance at another centre for many years. The concert was also notable for
            our collaboration with Umbrella Studio and ABC Open which resulted in a photo artists group forming to
            produce a video of images to accompany Schulthorpe’s Mangrove.
        </p>
        <p>
            We provided an ensemble to play at Anzac Park in September as part of the Bandstand Centenary event and then
            in October we presented Hats off to Gilbert and Sullivan. This was a quite demanding production devised and
            conducted by Richard McIntyre and involved 80 singers from North Queensland Opera and Music Theatre and
            Townsville Choral Society. The chorus combined with a sizable orchestra well and truly filled the Civic
            stage for what was essentially a Gilbert and Sullivan tribute show featuring excerpts from three operettas
            tied together by a narrator. 2013 saw us maintain our membership numbers and our financial position remained
            strong. We cover approximately 60% of our expenditure from box office income (which is considered to be very
            good by not-for-profit arts organisation standards) and the remainder is covered by grants, sponsorship and
            philanthropy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Townsville City Council continues to be our principal sponsor with a generous grant that covers our on-going
            core operational expenses. The Wheeler Family Charitable Gift Fund has also continued its strong support and
            it was pleasing to welcome Wilmar Sugar as a new sponsor in 2013. Wilmar are supporting us in our Burdekin
            performance initiative. Great in-kind support has continued from Sturt Business Centre, ASAP Printers, Signs
            of Excellence and the Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition. A new fund raising approach in 2013 was our
            Benefactors appeal. This has had a good start with 17 benefactors currently enrolled and the first renewals
            about to commence. I believe this particular avenue of fund raising will strengthen over time and prove to
            be a very reliable source of income provided it is proactively managed. 2013 saw our first encouragement
            awards. Two young orchestra members – Craig Land and Lexie Gorton – each received a well deserved $500 award
            in recognition of their enthusiastic participation in the orchestra and their musical development. I am
            pleased that the committee is continuing the encouragement awards in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would like to thank all the players who together produced such excellent performances in 2013. Our
            audience is growing and the quality of our concerts is certainly one of the reasons for this. I would also
            like to acknowledge the hard working committee who do so much behind the scenes. Particular thanks are due
            to Alan Nixon who is now retiring after seven years as Secretary and to Annette Ellis who has been Treasurer
            for seven years and is continuing in that position. Special mention must also be made of Stephen
            Frewen-Lord’s continuing role as Concert Master and the tireless efforts of several rehearsal conductors.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I am now retiring as President this is my last report. Over the last five years it has been gratifying to
            see the Barrier Reef Orchestra make considerable progress. In 2009 the orchestra was in the doldrums. It was
            drawing an audience of 150 or less, had less than $10,000 in cash reserves and performed as an orchestra of
            about 40 players. In fact the mid year concert in 2009 was cancelled because we simply could not muster the
            players required for the concert program. We are now drawing a audience of 300 to 400 if not more, have cash
            reserves around $70,000 and field an orchestra of 60 to 70 players, depending on the program. We have also
            had a paid manager for several years and our current manager Sally Frewen-Lord has achieved organisational
            wonders. This transformation has occurred only because of the great effort that has been put in over years
            by managers, members both playing and non-playing, by committee members and by sponsors, supporters and
            philanthropists, so it is very much a team effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am confident that this enthusiasm and support will continue under Andrew Ryder’s presidency and the
            orchestra will retain and enhance its position as one of the leading organizations in Townsville’s arts
            community.
