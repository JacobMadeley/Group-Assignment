            As promised, Ji Won Kim duly performed in our March Concert Romantic Interludes at the Riverway Arts Centre.
            This well attended concert featured Beethoven Violin Concerto with Ji Won giving a stunning performance. The
            concert also included Schubert’s Rosamunde Overture and the “unfinished” Symphony No. 8 by Schubert.
            Conductor was Professor John Hopkins.

            The string section of the Orchestra played at our major sponsor Queensland Nickel’s Open Day in May.

            In July we celebrated our 10th anniversary with a concert conducted by Richard McIntyre who also conducted
            the first Barrier Reef Orchestra ten years ago. This was an afternoon tea concert with table settings of ten
            at Jupiters Hotel Ballroom with high tea served at interval. It was a mixed program intended to suit the
            occasion with two pieces repeated from the first concert and highlighting the talents of nine local
            musicians as soloists including John Coulton from London on trumpet (but as an ex Pimlico High Student still
            counted as local). This concert was extremely well received and also included the distribution of the newly
            published 10 year commemorative history of the Orchestra prepared by Jean Dartnall.

            Our October concert featured the 2009 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Rebecca Chan. It was
            held at Dancenorth Studio with Professor John Hopkins conducting. Rebecca gave a memorable performance of
            Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4 and Vaughn Williams Lark Assending. The concert was at 5.0pm and titled
            Twilight Classics with a varied program including Delibes, Elgar and Grainger. An end of year BBQ followed
            for members and guests. As special guest performers we also had Pimlico Chamber Strings who gave a short
            recital which demonstrated the talents that won them the Queensland Fanfare Award for 2010.
