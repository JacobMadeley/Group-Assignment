<h1>CP1406/1806/5638 - 2017 Group Project Report</h1>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Nicholas Barty (JC 463287) , Jacob Madeley (JC 429882)</p>
<h2>Project Links</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="index.html" target="_blank">Site Home Page</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/JacobMadeley/Group-Assignment" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> ("nbart1" is
        Nicholas Barty, "JacobMadeley" is Jacob Madeley)
    </li>
    <li>We did not use slack, we used facebook
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Completed Work by Who</h2>
<p>brief details of who did what</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Jacob Madeley: </strong> Index (home) page, Donation page, Banner for top of those pages,</li>
    <li><strong>Nicholas Barty: </strong> About Us page, Join us page, Artists Page, Gallery Page, all individual people
        pages from Join us and Artists Page's, 90-95% of CSS
    </li>
    <li>Planning page was completed equally, as well as this page</li>

</ul>
<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>All forms submit, but go nowhere. There is no feeder page, it was not made. Links to individual artist pages are not
    very visible, you must click on the image to get to their page.
</p>
<h2>References</h2>
<p>- We used snippets of Lindsay's javascript for the about us page character counter, this came from his github repo:
    <a
            href="https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/JavaScriptExamples" target="_blank">https://github.com/lindsaymarkward/JavaScriptExamples</a><br>
    - Gallery java script was also used from W3-Schools tutorials: <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp</a><br>
    - While the rest of the code was written ourselves, some parts of it (mainly CSS) was guided heavily by many of the
    tutorials on the W3-Schools website, such as tables and forms guides on what selectors are available to use to style
    the elements. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/</a>

<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Easy communication, process of doing pages was easy (pick a page you want to do). An aspect
    we liked is how flexible we were able to get the divs to display people on the Artists page and Join Us pages, no
    tables were used (divs were coded to be like tables, but no "tables" used) and you just code up however many people
    per line you want as you need to. Another aspect we liked was how flexible the design was overall, considering no
    bootstrap or viewport considerations were put in place, the website scaled fairly well to mobile size and smaller
    window sizes. </p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Just picking pages led to similar but also generally different designs, not being able to
    use the same IDE (Jacob-Dreamweaver, Nicholas-PHP Storm) also caused troubles when opening up the code, as the IDE's
    format the code differently, making it hard to work on each others work to fix or add parts to the website. Not
    doing the feeder page is also a huge negative. Code is also not commented and all of the images, inparticular on the
    Artists page does not have ALT text for screen readers or incase the images don't load(didn't get time)</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> (including significant lessons) How the div "tables" were so fluid. Much of the site
    is the same code, just repeated with different links, images and text; overall the website does not have too much
    different code (however, it does take a long time to copy paste what you have made, then change the small parts that
    make the site work). Much of the CSS could most likely be improved, but as we ran out of time, we did not clean it
    up.<br><br>
    The most significant lesson from this project; do not leave the project until week 13!, we did milestone 1, got
    caught up in other assignments and then we had to hand in this website, leaving too much work to do, especially with
    one of us having a few more life commitments than the other, meaning the website is far worse off than it could have
    potentially been (only our own fault thought).<br><br>
    Something else important is understanding the content, even after completing what we are hading in, we are sure that
    we have missed many parts of what we needed to do, the feeder page being one of these. Overall we were unsure of
    what content to use on most pages and essentially recreated the old website with some better aesthetics.<br><br>
    Overall, we were unhappy with what we have produced as we know we could have done better, and should have worked
    harder to accomplish what we set out to do.
