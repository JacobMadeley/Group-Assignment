        History Of The Orchestra
    </div>
    <div class="textBodyMedium">
        <p>
            Over a two-year period in the late nineties, Townsville musicians, arts workers and a group of people who
            had a love for music realised the potential for developing a community-based Orchestra — one that would
            flourish and become an integral part of the City’s cultural life.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2000 to ‘test’ the viability of establishing an Orchestra a weekend workshop was arranged and musicians
            were invited to participate under the baton of Richard McIntyre, Senior Lecturer at the Canberra School of
            Music and the result — the Barrier Reef Orchestra was born.
            During the past few years, the Orchestra has performed with the comedy-duo Scared Weird Little Guys in
            Score, Townsville City Council’s Last Night of the Proms and A Christmas Carol. In 2003 the Council’s
            centenary year the Orchestra took part in Encore, as well as playing a major role in the Townsville Civic
            Theatre’s 25th Anniversary productions of Noye’s Fludde and Carmina Burana.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a typical year the Barrier Reef Orchestra, under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc, performs
            three times generally with a guest conductor and occasionally with other performing groups. Smaller
            ensembles, all utilising players from the Orchestra, regularly give concerts — Orpheus Strings, Pandanus
            Winds, Kingfisher Trio, Centenary Concert Band and the Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra. In 2004, the
            Orchestra presented its first subscription series of three concerts receiving sponsorship from Queensland
            Nickel – Yabulu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high standard is due in no small measure to the guidance and inspiration of our founding Patron,
            Professor John Hopkins OBE and conductor Richard McIntyre OAM.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2006 the orchestra became a truly North Queensland orchestra when in March a number of string players
            from Cairns travelled to Townsville to rehearse under Professor Hopkins for the planned Tchaikovsky concert.
            Unfortunately, the interruption of Cyclone Larry prevented the repeat performance scheduled for Cairns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final concert for 2006 , ‘Amadeus’, celebrated the life of this great composer in his 250th anniversary
            year. The Barrier Reef Orchestra could think of no better way in which to celebrate their sixth anniversary!
