      <h1 align="center">Past Events</h1>
      <p align="center">An outstanding performance of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony presented to a sell-out audience was recently followed by Peter Sculthorpe’s Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios. The programs are testament to the orchestra’s willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as opportunities for collaboration. <br>
      <p align="center">In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the Townsville Civic Theatre season. This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its continued prominence in the cultural soundscape of North Queensland.
