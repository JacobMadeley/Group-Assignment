            Jenny Carr came to Australia from Scotland in the early 70s and instantly became an integral part of the
            Townsville music scene as a pianist and instrumental music teacher. In 1998 when the decision was made to
            establish a community orchestra, Jenny worked as librarian, performer and for many years as Manager . In
            conjunction with Donna McMahon and Susan Linge (from the Civic Theatre), they arranged a series of concerts
            for the emerging orchestra. She also played with the orchestra when a pianist was needed. As Manager, she
            was involved in all aspects of handling the orchestra's music and checking attendances. In later years,
            Jenny worked as Adjudicatorâ€™s Assistant for the Australian Vocal and Concerto Competition.
