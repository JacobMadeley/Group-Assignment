        <p>Jennifer Bradstreet completed a Bachelor of Music with Honours at the Sydney Conservatorium, before taking up
            a summer scholarship at St Andrews and Oxford in the UK, and then moving to London in 2010. She became a
            student at the Royal College of Music under British flautist Susan Milan, and graduated with a Postgraduate

            While in London, she played in side-by-side projects with the London Symphony and was invited onto the
            prestigious BBC Symphony Orchestral pathway. Many summer scholarships and international master-classes
            followed, in Germany, England and Italy.
