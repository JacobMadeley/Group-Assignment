            Stephen Frewen-Lord <br> Life member since May 2015
        </div>
        <p>
            Stephen has been involved with the Barrier Reef Orchestra since its inception; having played as concert
            master in the orchestra’s inaugural concert in 2000. Since then, he has missed only a couple of Barrier Reef
            Orchestra concerts, and has been concert master for most concerts.
        </p>
        <p>
            When not rehearsing with the BRO, Stephen is involved in a number of ensembles around Townsville. He manages
            and plays with the Melaleuca String Quartet, directed Strings Non Troppo, and plays in Double Play – a
            guitar/violin duo. Stephen has had regular involvement with the Mulkadee Arts Festival, and performs
            regularly in community events such as Eco Fiesta, Riverfest, Heritage Day and Stable on the Strand.
            In his role as concert master over the past 15 years, Stephen has enjoyed many discussions with guest
            conductors concerning the artistic direction of the orchestra.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a string teacher, he has encouraged many young string players to become regular members of the orchestra.
            Stephen loves his involvement with the orchestra, and is delighted to be joined by young players who share
            his passion for music. Stephen is looking forward to passing on the baton to the next BRO concert master!
