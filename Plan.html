<p>CP1406 - Assignment 2 - Project Plan
</p>
<p>Names: Nick Barty (JC 463287) , Jacob Madeley (JC 429882)</p>
<p>Goals: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p> The goal of the website is to update the existing Barrier Reef Orchestra website to give it a more professional
        look and feel, making sponsors and future club members more likely to donate. The site also intends to try
        appeal to younger people to get them joining as well create increased community interest towards the orchestra
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Success Evaluation: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p> The website will be successful if it's updated to have a more professional look and feel, increased amount of
        sponsors, club members and younger people joining as well as a heightened community interest
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Target Audience:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> The target audience of the website is younger people (roughly 14-25) as well as potential benefactors as these
        are the main people that the website needs to reach out to in order to ascertain the website goal. The site will
        be designed to reach out to younger people mainly but will also be suitable for older people to use as well.
        <br><br>
        This will be achieved by using a uniform design (colour scheme, layout, etc) that is easy to understand and has
        high usability. The site will also be designed with clear and concise navigation as well as easy to read content
        that isn't overly long and tedious to read
    </p>
